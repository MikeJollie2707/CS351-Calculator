**Simple Calculator **

This project involves creating a basic calculator that can perform operations like addition, 
subtraction, multiplication, and division. HTML will be utilized to create the user interface, 
including number buttons and operation signs, CSS will style the calculator to be user-friendly, 
and JavaScript will manage the calculator's logic and handle user input to perform calculations. 
Enhancements might involve adding the ability to perform more complex calculations or creating 
different themes for the calculator.
